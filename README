# Hannah's Coding Study Guide 

## Description

After 6 years of sales leadership and 3 startup companies, I am tired of being envious of the amazing Software Engineers in my company. It's time to jump in myself! 

This is a massive pivot in my career, but it is one that I have dreamed since the day I was exposed to it. This study guide is one of the first steps I've taken in my journey, and I can't wait to look back on it one day and chuckle at all of the notes that will then seem like second nature to me. 

But for now, this will be used religiously as my cheat sheet to breaking into this exciting world of creation through coding.
